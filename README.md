# Floods
Flood Prediction
In this project, we are trying to apply Machine Learning Models to solve the problem of floods in resource restricted settings. To reach that goal, data was also very important and so one of the initiatives was to establish a data infrastructure for continuos data set for developing and calibrating future models develoed in similar environments. The amin focus was to have a one day ahead flood preciction models to be used as part of early warning systems.
